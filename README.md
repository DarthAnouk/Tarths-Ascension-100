# Tarths-Ascension-100
 The electronic-enabled costume of my Dystopia Rising LARP character

## Background
Dystopia Rising is a national, ongoing, live action roleplaying game <dystopiarising.com>. My character is an Ascensorite named Tarth (they/them). Every 100 XP, Ascensorites get a "body" modification. The one I have chosen is light-up arms. 

I'm doing this via a tutorial I found online <> which involves weaving fiber optic wire through tulle fabric and attaching LEDs to the end so that it lights up. I'm connecting this to an PCB so that I can program the RGB LEDs to become different colors in case I want to modify them at any time.
